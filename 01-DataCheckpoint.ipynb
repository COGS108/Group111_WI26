    "Online food delivery or on-demand food delivery, has become an essential part of consumers’ everyday eating behaviors. The consumers can search for and order food from various restaurants on digital platforms, then couriers deliver the food to the consumers’ doorstep. This allows consumers to reduce time costs for food purchases by eliminating the physical effort of commuting and waiting in line at food establishments. According to a paper “Delivery time reliability in on-demand food delivery: Heterogeneity from attribution effects,” they emphasize the significance of on demand food delivery by stating how “The global ODFD revenue has increased by more than 60 percent, from 254.7 billion US dollars in 2020 to 424.5 billion US dollars in 2024 (Statista, 2024)” (Ma et al.). Since the online food delivery market has been growing significantly, the competition among the delivery platforms has increased as well. Therefore, these platforms have to run their operations more efficiently to remain profitable without hurting customer satisfaction. So these platforms have to understand how consumers think and behave (e.g., how they value delivery time, reliability, delays, and service promises), then use this information to build better decision-making models (e.g., pricing, delivery-time promises, dispatching, and capacity allocation). These platforms no longer simply deliver and provide service, but make effective decisions while being aware of what makes things profitable for them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it was observed from this paper that delivery cost and expected delivery time does negatively impact the use of on demand food delivery (ODFD), but the time sensitivity (consumers’ satisfaction in response to delivery time) varies on the consumers. Consumers are generally less sensitive to delivery time during peak hours and of long-distance orders, likely due to them adjusting their service expectations to be more lenient with these circumstances. Early deliveries tend to increase overall usage of ODFD which leads to the idea that people generally like receiving orders earlier than expected, however, there are consumers who dislike early delivery, potentially because they aren’t ready to receive or haven’t arrived at a designated spot for pick up. While late deliveries are widely seen as bad service and decreases ODFD usage. But the late deliveries for long distance orders are less negatively effective because consumers may be more lenient, expecting uncertainty and forgiving of delays. The paper developed and tested their own hypotheses as well. For instance, there was no significant effect between blaming the late delivery to riders and consumer utility of ODFD for Hypothesis 1 (Consumers will exhibit lower levels of dissatisfaction (lower reliability sensitivity) if they tend to attribute the delivery unreliability to delivery riders). Hypothesis 2 is supported (if customers blame the restaurant, they feel more negative about the late delivery). Hypothesis 3 is not supported (if customers blame the platform, they feel less negative). \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these results, we saw how the cost of food delivery and expected delivery time are the factors that have a lot of impact on the ratings and satisfaction of their experience with online food delivery. But this study emphasizes how the factors that contribute to the customers’ satisfaction to expected delivery time varies based on customers like location, day of the week, time of the week, distance, what they were doing, etc. Therefore, we want to include other factors that can contribute to customer satisfaction with delivery time which will be reflected in their ratings. The factors we considered that are included in our dataset are time of the food order and what day of the week did the customer order as these factors will contribute to the customers’ service expectations which contributes to their ratings of their food delivery orders. From there, our group narrowed down our interests to factors of food delivery like pricing, delivery time, and more that can contribute to customer satisfaction since these reviews on food delivery platforms take many factors into consideration besides food quality. Along with these factors, we also took into consideration the hypotheses the paper tested when developing our own hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After researching more information about food delivery, we came across a relevant peer-reviewed study that provides theoretical grounding for our research question is “Determinants of Customer Satisfaction via Online Food Delivery Applications”, by Chanin Yoopetch, Pisit Siriphan, and Suthawan Chirapanda (2022). In this study, the authors surveyed 411 users of food delivery apps and used structural equation modeling to analyze how menu variety, food quality, delivery quality, and perceived app value influence customer satisfaction. Their findings showed that perceived value had the strongest effect on restaurant satisfaction, followed by delivery quality, while menu variety and food quality had comparatively weaker direct effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the results indicate that delivery performance (including speed, reliability, and overall efficiency) has a stronger and more consistent influence on customer satisfaction than food preparation-related factors alone. These findings suggest that customer may be more sensitive to delivery issues than preparation delays and provide theoretical support for our research question. However, applying these findings requires consideration of alternative perspectives and potential threats to validity. Although this prior research highlights the importance of delivery-related factors, customer satisfaction is multidimensional, meaning factors such as preparation time, cuisine type, order cost, and ordering context (e.g. day of the week) may still influence outcomes. While cuisine-related or menu based characteristics are included in our analysis, they are not a primary focus, as the referenced study found menu-related factors to have comparatively smaller effects on satisfaction outcomes. Instead, our project emphasizes operational variables more directly tied to delivery performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking through online Git projects, we were able to find a few repositories focusing on Food Delivery Times through the usage of prediction models. The repo that we observed the most is delivery_time_prediction, with its creator cleaning a publicly provided dataset on Kaggle, and optimizing it for the prediction model. After exploring a few possible relationships and hypotheses, the variables that ended up contributing the most to food delivery time were: age of the delivery driver, rating of the delivery driver, and the distance between restaurant and delivery location. These findings align with our research question, and poses more inquiry whether or not these results are similar across different scenarios and datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for our group project, we aim to narrow our attention to the factors that have been proven to show potential impact on customer satisfaction such as food delivery time. In our project, we will define food preparation time as the time (in minutes) taken by the restaurant to prepare the food which is calculated by taking the difference between the timestamps of the restaurant's order confirmation and the delivery person's pick-up confirmation. While defining delivery time as the time taken by the delivery person to deliver the food package which is calculated by taking the difference between the timestamps of the delivery person's pick-up confirmation and drop-off information. \n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The food delivery platforms tend to ask the consumers for consent with privacy policies and app permissions for certain personal information like location, payment details, name, and more, while using the app. Therefore, these consumers know that these apps have access to and store their information they allow when using the app. We do acknowledge that people may not be aware if their information is being used for data for project purposes or are open to the public. But we are considering the possibility that these platforms have included the chances of their data being used for research purposes in their privacy policies, however, we don’t know for sure. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Example of how to use the checkbox, and also of how you can put in a short paragraph that discusses the way this checklist item affects your project.  Remove this paragraph and the X in the checkbox before you fill this out for your project\n",
    "> \n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "*We recently found these datasets and are still looking over any biases and inconsistencies. But we notice for the first dataset that there were only options for ratings out of 5 are 3, 4, 5, and not given. This detail will create bias in that the data in this first dataset only have positive reviews so the data will be not representative of all the reviews on Foodhub app for New York City restaurants. Therefore, we are considering using this dataset, but strongly make it clear of these biases that this dataset has created.*\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Our dataset already minimizes the available PII exposure, with only order ID and customer ID being the only personalized information. All the other collected information is considered as necessary and vital for the analysis.*\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "*This bias mitigation is not an issue to be considered since the collected data in the dataset does not have specific personalized information that would result in bias outcomes.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Since the data is collected from Foodhub, the company would already have an established protection plan to secure the user data.*\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "*This is not a necessary mechanism since individual personal information is not available within the dataset beyond order ID and customer ID.*\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "*The dataset is publicly available from Foodhub, therefore we do not have ownership of the data and how it is used.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Yes, we did consider addressing a potential blindspot with the dataset originating from New York City. Due to the city’s culture of being fast-paces, we would need to consider how this might additionally affect delivery time.*\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?<br>\n",
    " \n",
    "*We're aware of how our primary dataset (NYC Restaurants Data) fails to include any ratings below 3 stars, and how 39% of the data points simply do not include a rating. This will make our dataset smaller than anticipated and may result in confirmation and/or volunteer bias, but we acknowledge this and will explain it in the discussion section of the final project.*\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data? <br>\n",
    " \n",
    "*We will ensure that our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports are honest to the represented data.*\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "*With our dataset, it only contains the most important data that is necessary for analysis. The most relevant PII is order ID, which is not a variable to be observed.*\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Yes, the analysis will be well documented to ensure that it is reproducible. All of our codes and visualizations will be documented and publicized to make sure that anyone can replicate our results and findings.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Our analysis does not use machine learning models, so we do not need to rely on variables or pixies that could create discriminator outcomes.*\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "*While we did not build predictive models, we considered fairness by checking that our data analysis does not unfairly favor or disadvantage any particular group.*\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Although our project does not involve building predictive models, we considered issues related to fairness, proxies, and interpretability in our analysis. We ensured that our variables do not unfairly discriminate between groups, that our results can be clearly explained, and that limitations, biases, and assumptions are communicated in a way that any potential stakeholders and readers can understand. By addressing these points, we aimed to make our findings transparent, equitable, and actionable without relying on machine learning models.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Since our group is still early into the decision making process of the project, we are unable to confirm or consider the ethical responsibilities of deploying a model to the public. Though this will still be a topic for consideration during the project if the idea of modeling arises.*\n",
