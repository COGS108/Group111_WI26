    "Online food delivery or on-demand food delivery, has become an essential part of consumers’ everyday eating behaviors. The consumers can search for and order food from various restaurants on digital platforms, then couriers deliver the food to the consumers’ doorstep. This allows consumers to reduce time costs for food purchases by eliminating the physical effort of commuting and waiting in line at food establishments. According to a paper “Delivery time reliability in on-demand food delivery: Heterogeneity from attribution effects,” they emphasize the significance of on demand food delivery by stating how “The global ODFD revenue has increased by more than 60 percent, from 254.7 billion US dollars in 2020 to 424.5 billion US dollars in 2024 (Statista, 2024)” (Ma et al.). Since the online food delivery market has been growing significantly, the competition among the delivery platforms has increased as well. Therefore, these platforms have to run their operations more efficiently to remain profitable without hurting customer satisfaction. So these platforms have to understand how consumers think and behave (e.g., how they value delivery time, reliability, delays, and service promises), then use this information to build better decision-making models (e.g., pricing, delivery-time promises, dispatching, and capacity allocation). These platforms can no longer simply deliver and provide service, but make effective decisions while being aware of what makes things profitable for them. From there, our group was interested in how factors of food delivery like pricing, delivery time, food quality, and more can contribute to customer satisfaction since these reviews on food delivery platforms take many factors into consideration besides food quality.\n",

    "Looking through online Git projects, we were able to find a few repositories focusing on Food Delivery Times through the usage of prediction models. The repo that we observed the most is delivery_time_prediction, with its creator cleaning a publicly provided dataset on Kaggle, and optimizing it for the prediction model. After exploring a few possible relationships and hypotheses, the variables that ended up contributing the most to food delivery time were: age of the delivery driver, rating of the delivery driver, and the distance between restaurant and delivery location. These findings align with our research question, and poses more inquiry whether or not these results are similar across different scenarios and datasets. \n",

    "We also were able to find a published research paper very similarly focused on our project topic. In this study, the authors, Yootetch el al. (2022) surveyed 411 experienced users of food delivery apps and analyzed factors such as menu variety, food quality, delivery quality, and the perceived value of the app. They used structural equation modeling to analyze the survey data and found that perceived app value had the strongest influence on customer satisfaction, followed by delivery quality. Factors such as menu variety and food quality actually had weaker effects on ratings. Their results suggest that customers are more affected by how reliable, efficient, and convenient the delivery experience is rather than food preparation factors alone. Based on these results, we expect to observe similar patterns in our project, with delivery-related factors having a stronger influence on customer satisfaction. \n",

    "- At least 1000 observations\n",
    "- We found the dataset from specific delivery apps from grubhubs, uber eats, etc...\n",

    "**First Dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/food-ordering-and-delivery-app-dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "-The dataset contain the variables: cost, day_of_the_week, rating, food_preparation_time, delivery_time. Using the food_preparation_time variable and the delivery_time variable, we can observer the total delivery time for the order. Moreover, we can also filter and split the day_of_the_week to see the weekday and weekend to see if there is a correlation with the customer rating. \n",

All of these variables provide us with the possiblity of finding the total delivery time while also considering in other facotrs like the courier's experience, leading to new hypothesis. While the dataset does not have a direct customer rating, we can use assumptions and scale the customer satisfaction based on the order total delivery time. \n",

Beyond these variables, we are also given the longitude and latitude of the delivery location and restraunt, allowing us to precisely locate the distance between destination. Additionally, the dataset allow us to see if the delivery's person ageand experience might impact the type of delivery they are assigned to, and if there is a correlation between better rated drivers and distance of delivery. \n"

    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The food delivery platforms tend to ask the consumers for consent with privacy policies and app permissions for certain personal information like location, payment details, name, and more, while using the app. Therefore, these consumers know that these apps have access to and store their information they allow when using the app. We do acknowledge that people may not be aware if their information is being used for data for project purposes or are open to the public. But we are considering the possibility that these platforms have included the chances of their data being used for research purposes in their privacy policies, however, we don’t know for sure. \n",

    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "*We recently found these datasets and are still looking over any biases and inconsistencies. But we notice for the first dataset that there were only options for ratings out of 5 are 3, 4, 5, and not given. This detail will create bias in that the data in this first dataset only have positive reviews so the data will be not representative of all the reviews on Foodhub app for New York City restaurants. Therefore, we are considering using this dataset, but strongly make it clear of these biases that this dataset has created.*\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?<br>\n",
    " \n",
    "*We're aware of how our primary dataset (NYC Restaurants Data) fails to include any ratings below 3 stars, and how 39% of the data points simply do not include a rating. This will make our dataset smaller than anticipated and may result in confirmation and/or volunteer bias, but we acknowledge this and will explain it in the discussion section of the final project.*\n",

    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data? <br>\n",
    " \n",
    "*We cannot yet account for this as we have not developed any visualizations, but we will surely keep it in mind when working on our EDA*\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "*We are still at an early stage of our project process so we haven’t implemented any sort of modeling so these ethical concerns cannot currently be evaluated. However, as we move into the modeling phase, we plan to be mindful of how variable choices and evaluation decisions could introduce bias*\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Since our group is still early into the decision making process of the project, we are unable to confirm or consider the ethical responsibilities of deploying a model to the public. Though this will still be a topic for consideration during the project if the idea of modeling arises.*\n",
